# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. I’m an experienced Software Developer with interests in technology fields such as **Product Development**,
**Automation**, **Microservice Architecture**, **Integration** and the **Internet-of-Things**. I’m particularly fond 
of working with tech stacks which are backed with Java services and fronted by React components.

I currently work as a Software Developer for OLM Systems, prior to which I was a DevOps/Platform Engineer 
with Virgin Money.
