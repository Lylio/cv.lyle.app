# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. I’m a Software Developer with interests in technology fields such as **App Development**,
**Automation**, **Microservice Architecture**, **Integration** and the **Internet-of-Things**. I’m particularly fond 
of working with tech stacks which are backed with Java services and fronted by React components.

I like building things, I like fixing things. I have a KanBan of tech tutorials that I like to chip away at in my spare time. 
I like Java, I like Spring Boot, Docker, Linux and React. I like Quarkus. I like Kubernetes. I like Shell scripting, Python scripting and
Groovy scripting. I'm currently learning Kotlin and I like it!
