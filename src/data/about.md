# Introduction
Hi I'm **Lyle**, welcome to my online CV and portfolio: **cv.lyle.app**  
<br>

Allow me to introduce myself: I‚Äôm an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Cloud Native, Desktop, Mobile, etc.), **SPAs**, **Microservices**, **Gaming**, 
**The-Internet-of-Things**, and many other branches found on life's *tree-of-tech*.

<br>

I‚Äôm particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are fronted by **React** components and backed with **Java** 
services. I'll also cheer for the **Spring** framework and my favourite Linux flavour is **Ubuntu** . Big fan of the 
*SURJ* stack.

*Tell us more, Lyle...*  
<br>

I like the satisfaction of **building** things and I like the lottery win of finding a **solution** for broken things. I have a long list of 
**tech tutorials** that I gnaw through most evenings and weekends and I **love** expanding my skills.  
<br>

I like **React** and **Java**. I also like **Spring Boot** and **JavaScript**. **Container Tech** is cool, 
**Docker** is dandy, **Linux** is *liberty*. **Kubernetes** is **Kubercoolies**.  
<br>

I enjoy writing good, Clean Code (¬© 2008 Robert C. Martin): cool scripts with **Bash** and **Python**. **Git** is great; 
I love a neat-and-tidy **codebase**. I like sensible and thoughtful **naming conventions** for variables, classes and 
functions. I like transparent and inclusive **documentation**.
<br/>

In summary: I like a **well-oiled** machine that's free of **filler or filter**. Cheers üçª.
