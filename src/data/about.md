# Introduction
Hi I'm **Lyle**, welcome to my online CV and portfolio: **cv.lyle.app**  
<br>

I‚Äôm an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Cloud Native, Desktop, SPAs, Mobile, etc.); I like **Microservices** architecture,
**Gaming**, and the **The-Internet-of-Things** looks interesting. Fiddling with **CSS** is fun and a successful **Jenkins
build** is a cause for celebration; and that's just a snapshot - there are many other branches found on life's 
*tree-of-tech* which pique my interest but are too numerous to list here.

<br>

I‚Äôm particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** 
components. I'll also cheer for the **Spring** framework and my favourite Linux flavour is **Ubuntu**. Basically,
I'm a big fan of the *SURJ* stack. Heh.

*Tell us more, old chap...* 


I like the satisfaction of **building** things and I like the lottery win of finding a **solution** for broken things. 
I have a long list of **tech tutorials** that I gnaw through most evenings and weekends: I'm really into expanding my 
skills and knowledge and spend a lot of time trying to become a better developer. I enjoy learning new languages, tools,
and frameworks. I have a personal KanBan which keeps track of my learning (hahahah, I'm kidding (I'm **not** kidding)).

<br>

I like **Java** and **React**. I also like **Spring Boot** and **JavaScript**. **Container Tech** is cool, 
**Docker** rocks, **Kubernetes** is **Kuberneato**. **Linux** is *liberty*; MacBooks *rule*.   
<br>

I enjoy writing good, **Clean Code** (¬© 2008 Robert C. Martin): I like cool automation scripts with **Bash** and **Python**. 
**Git** is great. A neat-and-tidy **codebase** brings me joy. I like sensible and thoughtful **naming conventions** 
for variables, classes and methods. I like clear and inclusive **documentation**. In summary: I like a **well-oiled** 
machine that's free of **filler and fuss**.

<br />Cheers üçª
