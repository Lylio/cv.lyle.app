# Introduction

Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Web, Mobile, Desktop, Cloud Native, SPAs, Websites, etc.). As a 
Java developer I love Object-oriented programming, but also love the slender coding experience of functional programming.
I think **Microservice** architecture is cool; I also like **Gaming** tech. **The-Internet-of-Things** is interesting 
(maybe more in the code that will end up auto-driving cars than the tech which will auto order cheese slices for your 
fridge).<br />
Iâ€™m fond of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** 
components. I'm a full-stack developer at heart and I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both sides of the 
*ends*.

I enjoy building things and I enjoy fixing things. I like creating cool components and building pipelines between them 
so they can shuttle streams of data between each other without friction or fuss. I have a long list of tech tutorials 
that I gnaw through most evenings and weekends. I like refreshing my current skill-set and I love expanding my current 
tech knowledge. I spend a lot of time becoming a better developer by learning new **tools**, **techniques**, 
and **trends**.

**Clean Code** is really important to me. A neat-and-tidy codebase makes me happy. I like cool automation scripts with
**Bash** and **Python**. I have an enduring enthusiasm for sensible and thoughtful naming conventions for 
variables, classes and methods. I like clear and inclusive documentation.

<br /> In summary: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of palaver or pain.
