# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are in **App Development**, **SPAs**,
**Microservice Architecture**, **AI**, **The-Internet-of-Things** and various other **fads-of-the-month**.

Iâ€™m particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are fronted by **React** components and backed with **Java** 
services.

I like the satisfaction of **building** things; I like the lottery win of finding a **solution**. I have a long list of **tech tutorials** 
that I gnaw through during most evenings and weekends. I like **React** and **JavaScript**, I also like **Java** and **Spring Boot**. 
**Docker** and **Container Tech** is cool. I'm a big fan of **Linux** and **MacOS**. I think **Cloud Tech** is cool, **Kubernetes** is **Kuber-coolies**. 
I enjoy writing lean, clean scripts with tech like **Python** and **Bash**. **Git** is great. I love a neat-and-tidy **codebase**. 
I like sensible, thoughtful naming conventions for variables, classes and functions ðŸ˜§. I like transparent and inclusive documentation ðŸ˜±. 
In summary: I like a lean machine without filler or filter ðŸ¤¢.
