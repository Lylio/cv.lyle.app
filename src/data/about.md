**Ahoy!** ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for stopping by. I'm **Lyle**, an experienced Software Engineer. My core tech skills list is an 
ongoing evolving list composed of professional experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are in 
App Development, SPAs, Microservices, Cloud Services, The Internet-of-Things and lots more. My technical interests are 
varied but can generally be located in **App Development** (e.g. **Web Apps**, **Desktop Apps**, **APIs**, **SPAs**, 
**Cloud Native** apps). There's a range of technology fields I take an interest in, from developing **Microservice** 
architecture to playing 
with **Gaming** tech tools.
<br /> 

There's also a lot of interesting things happening with **The-Internet-of-Things** (in the sense of cool code that will 
auto-drive the vehicles of the future rather than the fridge tech which will auto-order our out-of-date cheese slices). 
**AI** is also fascinating (ChatGPT is now on my Christmas card list). There's a *boat load* of tech problems nipping at
out heels: cyber-security and cyber-ransomware; data privacy; business continuity & disaster recovery; and deepfake
content, which is the one that seriously keeps me awake at night.

At heart, I'm a full stack engineer. I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back end tooling 
environments. Currently, I'm very much enjoying reacquainting myself with front-end tooling and the Angular
framework.

I enjoy building things and I *quite* enjoy fixing things. I like creating tech components and composing deployment 
pipelines for cool app features to 'go live' using scripting tools like **Python** and **Bash**. I have a long list of 
tech tutorials that I chew through in my evenings and weekends. I continuously refresh my current skill-set and I enjoy 
expanding my ongoing tech knowledge by learning new **tools**, **techniques**, and **trends**.
<br />

**Clean Code** (Martin, 2008) is at the core of my ethos: a neat-and-tidy codebase makes me *very* happy. In all 
seriousness, I have enthusiasm for sensible naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** 
and **inclusive** documentation. 


**In summary**: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of *palaver* or *pain*. ðŸ™‚
