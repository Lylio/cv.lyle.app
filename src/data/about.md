# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. I’m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are in **App Development**, **SPAs**,
**Microservice Architecture**, **AI**, **The-Internet-of-Things** and various other **fads-of-the-month**.

I’m particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are fronted by **React** components and backed with **Java** 
services.

I like the satisfaction of **building** things; I like the lottery win of finding a **solution**. I have a long list of **tech tutorials** 
that I gnaw through during most evenings and weekends. I like **React** and **JavaScript**. I also like **Spring Boot** and **Java**. 
**Docker** and **Container Tech** is good.**Linux** is fab. I think **Cloud Tech** is neat and **Kubernetes** is **Kuber-coolies**. 
I enjoy writing lean, clean scripts with **Bash** and **Python**. **Git** is great. I love a neat-and-tidy **codebase** 🤗. 
I like sensible and thoughtful **naming conventions** for variables, classes and functions 😄. I like transparent and inclusive **documentation** 😍. 
In summary: I like a **well-oiled** machine that's free of **filler or filter** 🥳💕.
