# Introduction

Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer. My technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. RESTful APIs, Web, Mobile, Desktop, Cloud Native, SPAs, etc.). As a 
Java developer I'm highly fond of object-oriented programming, but I also have a deep appreciation for the svelte 
feel of functional coding. There's a range of technology fields I take an interest in, from developing **Microservice** 
architecture to the latest updates in **Gaming** tech. There's a lot of interesting things happening with 
**The-Internet-of-Things** ("interesting" perhaps more in the sense of cool code that will auto-drive the vehicles of 
the future rather than the fridge tech which will auto-order finished cheese slices).

<br />

I'm a full-stack developer at heart and I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back end. Iâ€™m very 
fond of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** components.

I enjoy building things (*most of the time*) and I enjoy fixing things (*some of the time*). I like creating tech 
components and composing pipelines between them so streams of data can be shuttled between in an end-to-end system 
without friction or fuss. I like cool automation scripts with **Bash** and **Python**. I have a long list of tech 
tutorials that I grind through most evenings and weekends. I like continuously refreshing my current skill-set and I 
really enjoy expanding my current tech knowledge. I spend a lot of time becoming a better developer by learning 
new **tools**, **techniques**, and **trends**.

<br />

**Clean Code** is really important to me. A neat-and-tidy codebase makes me happy. I have an enduring enthusiasm for 
sensible and thoughtful naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** and **inclusive** 
documentation.

<br /> In summary: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of palaver or pain.
