# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. I’m a Software Developer with interests in technology fields such as **App Development**,
**Automation**, **Microservice Architecture**, **Integration** and the **Internet-of-Things**. I’m particularly fond 
of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** components.

I like building things, I like fixing things. I have a long list of tech tutorials that I chew through of an evening. 
I like **Java**, I like **Spring Boot**, I like **Docker**, **Linux** and **React**. I like **Quarkus**. I like 
**Kubernetes**. I like **Shell** scripting and **Python** scripting. **Git** is great, **Groovy** is groovy, 
**Gradle** is grand. **REST**, **CRUD** and **ORM**. **JRE**, **JDK** and **JVM**.
