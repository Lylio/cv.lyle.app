# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. I’m an experienced Software Developer with interests in technology fields such as **Product Development**,
**Automation**, **Microservice Architecture**, **Integration** and the **Internet-of-Things**. I’m particularly fond 
of working with tech stacks which are backed with Java services and fronted by React components.

I like building things, I like fixing things, I have a KanBan of tech tutorials that I slowly chip away at. I like Java,
Spring Boot, Docker, Linux, React. I'm learning Kotlin, I can get by in JavaScript, Python is good. Databases are ok, 
monitoring and reporting bores me. I hate deciphering error logs.
