# Introduction
Hi I'm **Lyle**, welcome to my online CV and portfolio: **cv.lyle.app**!  
<br>

Allow me to introduce myself: I‚Äôm an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Cloud Native, Desktop, Mobile, etc.), **SPAs**, **Microservices**, **Gaming**, 
**The-Internet-of-Things**, **VR**, and many other branches found on life's *tree-of-tech*.

<br>

I‚Äôm particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are fronted by **React** components and backed with **Java** 
services. I'll also cheer for the **Spring** framework and my favourite Linux flavour is **Ubuntu** . Thinking about it, I guess that 
makes me a fan of the... **SURJ** stack then?! heh, ahem ü•¥.

*Tell us more, Lyle...*  
<br>

I like the satisfaction of **building** things and I like the lottery win of finding a **solution** for broken things. I have a long list of 
**tech tutorials** that I gnaw through most evenings and weekends and I **love** expanding my skills.  
<br>

I vehemently dislike job interviews which mandate the misery of *code exams* or *technical interviews* or *uncomfortable 2-hour paired-programming evaluations*. 
This process is bizarre; I wouldn't ask a plumber to weld some scrap pipes together while I scored their performance before 
green-lighting them to install a new bathroom.  
<br>

A good developer is not determined by how many pointless, little algorithmic puzzles they can solve in a generous *10-minute* timeframe. 
For example, many developers think HackerRank proves very little about their value as software technicians, and they'd be right: no developer's
job is to spend 8-hours a day thinking of unique ways to recursively calculate the Fibonacci sequence.  
<br>

Ok, ok, ok - I'm beginning to sound like a grump who's not had any lunch. Thinking a little more positively: I like **React** and **Java**. I also like **Spring Boot** and **JavaScript**. 
**Container Tech** is cool, **Docker** is dandy, **Linux** is my *liege*. I'm not ashamed to say it: **Kubernetes** is **KUBER-COOLIES!!** ü•≥ ".  
<br>

I enjoy writing good, clean code: cool scripts with **Bash** and **Python** (of course with Robert C. Martin's watchful eye and thoughtful comments). 
**Git** is great, Oh how I love a neat-and-tidy **codebase** ü•∞... I like sensible and thoughtful **naming conventions** for variables, clases and functions üòÑ. 
I like transparent and inclusive **documentation** üôÇ. There's tons I like...
<br/>

In summary: I like a **well-oiled** machine that's free of **filler or filter**. Here's cheers üçª.
