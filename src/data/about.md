# Introduction
Hello I'm Lyle. Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are in **App Development**, **SPAs**,
**Microservice Architecture**, **AI**, **The-Internet-of-Things** and various other **fads-of-the-month**.

Iâ€™m particularly fond of working with tech stacks which are fronted by **React** components and backed with **Java** 
services.

I like the satisfaction of **building** things; I like the lottery win of finding a **fix**. I have a long list of **tech tutorials** 
that I chew through during most evenings and weekends. I like **React** and **JavaScript**, I like **Java** and **Spring Boot**. 
I like **Docker** and **Container Tech**. I'm a big fan of **Linux** and **MacOS**. **Cloud Tech** is cool, I like **Kubernetes**. 
I enjoy writing lean, clean scripts with **Python** and **Bash**. **Git** is great. I like a neat-and-tidy **codebase**. I like
sensible **names** for variables, classes and functions ðŸ˜§. I like clear and inclusive **documentation** ðŸ˜±. In summary, you guys: I really like
**learning** how to do something *better* that I had previously been doing **terribly**! ðŸ¤¢
