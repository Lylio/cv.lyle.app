# Intro

Hello I'm Lyle (*radioactive levels of cynicism; the patience of a toddler*).

# Currently

I currently work as a **Software Developer** for [OLM Systems](https://www.olmsystems.com/). I enjoy *Product Development*, *Automation*, *Microservice Architecture*,
*Containerisation*, *Continuous Integration/Delivery* and the *Internet-of-Things*.


# Development Philosophy

What I find, in general, is people who are lacking skills in *writing* also lack skills in *writing code*. Which isn't surprising.
What are we doing when we create code? We're writing stuff, with words and numbers and the internal kinesis within this written framework is that the
human *writes* something for the computer to interrogate and transform. Code might look like nonsense to the casual observer as it's stripped down into
a naked hierarchy of machine instructions - but there's words, there's numbers, there's punctuation and symbols,
and it's assembled on a "page" to be looked at by uman eyes and machine interpreters.

During my time as a developing developer, the whole process of writing my own code while reviewing how other software engineers approach problems, lead to
my own taste, my own list of good and better coding practices becoming crystalised in the back of my mind. It was both pleasantly surprising and also sincerely
reassuring that when I read Robert C. Martin's seminal [*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) (2008)
that much of the content's critique of programming practices aligned with my own conclusions, and in many areas mirrored the advice I was already passing on to
colleagues and collaborators.

# Interests

I'm a musician who has written and recorded many albums over the years. My first band was started in high school with a couple of great pals, and over the years I've worked with a plethora of
fantastic friends, artists, wonderful multi-skilled creative individuals who will forever remain in my heart, keeping that beat-on-beat-on. 

Since 2007 I've been a 'solo' musician, writing, recording, playing, producing my 
records which I release under my own label [Flaky Records](https://www.flakyrecords.com). It's all vanity bulldust which has never earned me penny - but every year or two,
this monkey on my back cracks his whip, and we start recording another collection for a new album.

My albums are available in the usual online supermarkets: **Spotify**, **Bandcamp**, **Apple Music** *et al*, *etc.* -
[www.lylechristine.com](https://www.lylechristine.com) has everything you desire.
