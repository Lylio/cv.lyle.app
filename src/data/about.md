# Introduction

Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Web Apps, Cloud Native, Desktop, SPAs, Mobile, etc.). As a Java developer I 
like **Microservice** architecture; I love **Gaming** tech; **The-Internet-of-Things** is interesting.



Iâ€™m fond of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** 
components. I like the **Spring** framework and my favourite Linux flavour is **Ubuntu**.

I like building things, I like fixing things, I like creating digital components and connecting them up, so they can
happily chit-chat streams of data between each other. I have a long list of tech tutorials that I gnaw through most 
evenings and weekends. I'm really into expanding my skills and knowledge and spend a lot of time trying to become a 
better developer. I enjoy learning new languages, tools, and frameworks.

**Container Tech** is cool, **Docker** rocks, **Kubernetes** is **Kuberneato!** I enjoy writing spotless, 
**clean code**. I like cool automation scripts with **Bash** and **Python**. **Git** is great: A neat-and-tidy 
**codebase** makes me happy. I like sensible and thoughtful naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. 
I like clear and inclusive documentation. 

<br /> In summary: I like a **well-oiled** machine that's free of **filler and fuss**.
