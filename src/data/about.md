# Introduction
Hullo.

Iâ€™m an experienced Software Developer and my technical interests are varied but can generally 
be located in **App Development** (e.g. Web Apps, Cloud Native, Desktop, SPAs, Mobile, etc.). I like **Microservice** 
architecture; I love **Gaming**; **The-Internet-of-Things** is where it's all headed.

<br>

Iâ€™m fond of working with tech stacks which are backed with **Java** services and fronted by **React** 
components. I like the **Spring** framework and my favourite Linux flavour is **Ubuntu**. Basically,
I'm a big fan of the *SURJ* stack. Heh. "Spring-Ubuntu-React-Java". Anyhoo...

I like building things and I like the lottery of finding a solution for broken things. 
I have a long list of tech tutorials that I gnaw through most evenings and weekends. I'm really into expanding my 
skills and knowledge and spend a lot of time trying to become a better developer. I enjoy learning new languages, tools,
and frameworks.

<br>

I love **Java** and **React**. I love **Spring Boot** and **JavaScript**. **Container Tech** is cool, 
**Docker** rocks, **Kubernetes** is **Kuberneato!**. **Linux, Linux, Linux**.

I enjoy writing spotless, **clean code**: I like cool automation scripts with **Bash**. 
**Git** is great. A neat-and-tidy **codebase** makes me happy. I like sensible and thoughtful **naming conventions** 
for variables, classes and methods. I like clear and inclusive **documentation**. 

<br />In summary: I like a **well-oiled** machine that's free of **filler and fuss**.

<br />**Come As You Are** ðŸŽ¸
