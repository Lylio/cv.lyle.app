Greetings again friends. üíï 
<br/><br/>
My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list composed of professional
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Java Back-End Development, 
Android Mobile App Development, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, Ai, System Design. I love building things; I like
fixing things; I'm not a fan of deadlines for building or fixing things. Heh.
<br/>
<br/>
I developed DevOps-skills while working as a *Platform Engineer* with Virgin Money, and my Java skills were
strengthened while working as a middleware *Java Developer* in the microservice data integration team with OLM Systems. 
Since April 2023 I've been a member with consultancy organisation CGI where my core area is *Java Development* (although 
my most recent project was for HM Courts and Tribunal Service which gave me an introduction to front-end tools such as 
Angular and TypeScript). I have since moved to the *Rural Payments and Services* (https://www.ruralpayments.org/) 
project as a Java Developer with the Agriculture and Rural Economies (ARE) project.
<br />
<br />
I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted 
to System Design and I enjoy understanding the architecture of a project: the *bird's eye view* is as important and 
interesting to me as the *worm's eye view*. I find scripting tools like Python and Bash a pleasure to use when 
integrating the CI/CD end-to-end deployment process; automating 'chore' where ever possible when using tools like 
Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and many other CI/CD applications has real job satisfaction. 
<br />
<br />
I really enjoy using my free-time to refresh and expand my current skill-set. In addition to advancing my Java skills,  
I'm also on track to become an SME on Android mobile development for CGI which includes deep-diving into the Kotlin
language. However, while learning Software Dev tools is important and comes with many benefits, I really feel that 
concepts and principles hold greater value than obsessions with <i>fads-of-the-day</i>.

Thanks for your time. ü™Å
