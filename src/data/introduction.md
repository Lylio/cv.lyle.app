**Hi!**

Here's me kissing your abs: ðŸ¤®... mmmmm, I look so happy; that sweet smell of public toilet soap is really exemplified 
by... never mind. Thank you, Sir, it's such an honour to be made to work for...  

My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list composed of professional experience, self-taught learning and
academic study. My interests are varied and located in areas such as App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, 
Cloud Tech, AI, The Internet-of-Things, System Design and lots more.
<br /> 

At heart, I'm a full stack engineer; I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back-end tooling 
environments. In my current role as a **front-end** developer with the HM Courts and Tribunal Service , I'm very much
enjoying reacquainting myself with the **Angular** framework, Node, Express, and all that "**FUN!!!**" with CSS.

I enjoy developing complex technical estates; I'm attracted to System Design and enjoy studying the HLD and LLD 
fundamentals of a project. I like the *bird's eye view* as much as I like the *worm's eye view*. 
I love creating app components and composing deployment pipelines using scripting tools like **Python** and **Bash**. 
<br>I have a long list of tech tutorials that I chew through in my evenings and weekends (i.e. I'm a geek who never
stops studying).<br>

I continuously refresh my current skill-set and I enjoy expanding my ongoing tech knowledge by learning the 
best-practices, industry-standards, **tools**, **techniques**, and **trends** which I'll need as a modern engineer.<br />

**Clean Code** (Martin, 2008) is at the core of my ethos: a neat-and-tidy codebase makes me **happy**! I'm a fan of 
sensible naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** and **inclusive** documentation.
Software Development isn't achieved in isolation; success in this realm is the result of collaboration and communication.

**In summary**: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of **palaver** or **pain**.

Come As You Are ðŸŽ¸
