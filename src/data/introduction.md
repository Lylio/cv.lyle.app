Greetings friends ðŸŽƒ .  
<br/>
My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list composed of professional
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Java Back-End Development, 
Android Mobile App Development, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, Ai, System Design. I like **building** things; I like
**fixing** things.
<br/>

Since April 2023 I've been a member with consultancy organisation CGI where my core area is *Java Development*. I 
currently work on the *Rural Payments and Services* (https://www.ruralpayments.org/) project as a middleware Java 
Developer; this is within the wider Agriculture and Rural Economies (ARE) project. Prior to CGI, my Java skills were 
strengthened while working as a middleware developer in the microservice data integration team with OLM Systems. 
Lastly, my CI/CD DevOps-skills were advanced while working as a Platform Engineer at Virgin Money.

I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
I enjoy understanding the architecture of a project: the *bird's eye view* is as important and interesting to me as the 
*worm's eye view*. I find scripting tools like Python and Bash a pleasure to use when integrating the CI/CD end-to-end 
deployment process; automating 'chore' where ever possible when using tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and many 
other CI/CD applications has real job satisfaction.

I really enjoy using my free-time to refresh and expand my current skill-set. In addition to emboldening my Java skills,  
I'm also into Android mobile development which includes deep-diving into the Kotlin language.
