My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list composed of professional 
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Back-End Development, 
Mobile App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, AI, The Internet-of-Things, System Design, 
and lots more.
<br/>

I developed DevOps-skills while working as a *Platform Engineer* with Virgin Money, and my Java skills were
strengthened while working as a middleware *Java Developer* in the microservice data integration team with OLM Systems. 
Since April 2023 I've been a member with consultancy organisation CGI where my core area is *Java Development* (although 
my most recent project was for HM Courts and Tribunal Service which gave me a introduction to front-end tools such as 
Angular and TypeScript).

<br />
I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
enjoy understanding the architecture of a project: *The bird's eye view is as important as the worm's eye view*.
I find scripting tools like Python and Bash a pleasure to use when integrating the CI/CD end-to-end deployment process; 
automating 'chore' where ever possible when using tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and many other CI/CD
applications has real job satisfaction. 
<br />
<br />
I use my free-time to refresh and expand my current skill-set. It's important to me that I progress my tech knowledge by 
learning best practices, industry-standards and current tools to maintain a 'T-shaped' engineering profile. 
<b>[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/profile/24431183)</b> is a favourite of mine to track skill progress: 
e.g. I'm currently refreshing on their Web Development and Python modules (check out the <b>[certificates](https://cv.lyle.app/certificates)</b> 
page).
