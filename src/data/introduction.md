**Ahoy!** ðŸŽ‰. I'm **Lyle**, an experienced Software Engineer. My core tech skills list is an 
ongoing evolving list composed of professional experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are 
varied and located in areas such as App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, AI, 
The Internet-of-Things, System Design and lots more.
<br /> 

At heart, I'm a full stack engineer. I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back-end tooling 
environments. In my current role, I'm very much enjoying reacquainting myself as a **front-end** developer using the 
**Angular** framework.

I enjoy building things and I *quite* enjoy fixing things. I like creating tech components and composing deployment 
pipelines using scripting tools like **Python** and **Bash**. I have a long list of tech tutorials that I chew 
through in my evenings and weekends. I continuously refresh my current skill-set and I enjoy expanding my ongoing 
tech knowledge by learning new **tools**, **techniques**, and **trends**.
<br />

**Clean Code** (Martin, 2008) is at the core of my ethos: a neat-and-tidy codebase makes me happy. I'm a fan of 
sensible naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** and **inclusive** documentation. 

**In summary**: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of **palaver** or **pain**.
