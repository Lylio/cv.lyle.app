My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list composed of professional 
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Back-End Development, 
Mobile App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, AI, The Internet-of-Things, System Design, 
and lots more.

I developed DevOps-skills while working as a **Platform Engineer** with Virgin Money, and my Java skills were
strengthened while working as a microservice **Java Developer** with OLM Systems. I'm 
currently a **Senior Java Developer** with consultancy organisation CGI, although my most recent project was for 
HM Courts and Tribunal Service which gave me a brief introduction to front-end tools such as Angular and TypeScript.

I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
enjoy understanding the architecture of a project: The *bird's eye view* is as important as the *worm's eye view*.
I love using scripting tools like Python and Bash to integrate with the CI/CD end-to-end deployment process and 
automate 'chore' where ever possible when using tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and many other CI/CD
applications.

I use my free-time to refresh and expand my current skill-set. It's important to me that I grasp every chance to 
embolden my tech knowledge by learning best practices, industry-standards and current tools as I hope to become a
Î -shaped engineer ("pi-shaped"). SoloLearn is one example of where I track my skills progress:I'm currently studying 
C++, Web Development and refreshing on Python. (Progress can be tracked on my <b>[CERTIFICATES](https://cv.lyle.app/certificates)</b>) page).
<br />

In addition to placing high importance on expanding tech-knowledge, it's also important to me to pursue 
training/experience opportunities which focus on soft-skills. My aim is that I can continue to raise my technician's 
skill level in addition to my capacity for critical thinking and emotional intelligence in order to be a high value
colleague to my employer and team-mates.
