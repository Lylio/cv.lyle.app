
Greetings and Salutations. My core tech skills list is an ongoing evolving list 
composed of professional experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied and located in 
areas such as App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, AI, The Internet-of-Things, System Design 
and lots more.
<br />
<br />
At heart, I'm a full stack engineer; I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back-end tooling 
environments. After two-and-a-half years in **DevOps**, then a year-and-a-half as a microservice **Java Developer**, 
I'm currently enjoying a **front-end** role as part of a large project for the HM Courts and Tribunal Service. It's a 
good time to deep-dive into **Angular**, **Node**, **TypeScript**, and all that CSS fun.

I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
enjoy studying the documentation of a project: I like the *bird's eye view* as much as I like the *worm's eye view*. 
I like creating app components and composing deployment pipelines using scripting tools like **Python** and **Bash**. 
<br><br>
I also have a long list of tech tutorials that I chew through in my evenings and weekends; basically, I'm a geek
and I use my free-time to continuously refresh my current skill-set. I really enjoy expanding my ongoing tech knowledge 
by learning the best practices, industry-standards, and the **tools**, **techniques** and **trends** of today.
<br /><br />

**Clean Code** (Martin, 2008) is at the core of my ethos: a neat-and-tidy codebase makes me *happy*. I'm a fan of 
sensible naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** and **inclusive** documentation.
Software Development isn't achieved in isolation; technical success is the result of complex collaboration and 
communication in which dialogue, thoughts and fears can flow freely without judgement.
<br /><br />

**In summary**: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of **palaver** or **pain**.

Come As You Are ðŸŽ¸
