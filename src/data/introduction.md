Introducing my core tech skills list is not so easy as it's an ongoing evolving list composed of professional 
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied and located in areas such as Back-End 
Development, App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Tech, AI, The Internet-of-Things, System Design 
and lots more.

<br/>
I developed DevOps-skills while working as a **Platform Engineer** with Virgin Media, and my Java skills were
strengthened while working for over a year-and-a-half as a microservice **Java Developer** with OLM Systems. I'm 
currently a **Senior Java Developer** with consultancy organisation CGI, although my most recent project was for 
HM Courts and Tribunal Service which gave me a brief introduction to front-end tools such as Angular and TypeScript.

I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
enjoy studying the documentation of a project: I like the *bird's eye view* as much as I like the *worm's eye view*. 
I like creating app components and composing deployment pipelines using scripting tools like Python and Bash. 
<br />
<br />
I also enjoy studying; I use my free-time to continuously refresh my current skill-set. I really enjoy expanding my 
ongoing tech knowledge by learning the best practices, industry-standards and new technologies which exist on my
various curated social media feeds. **SoloLearn** is my current favourite learning platform. I'm currently refreshing
my skills in Python and Web Development. Progress can be tracked on my <b>[CERTIFICATES](https://cv.lyle.app/certificates)</b>
page.

like creating app components and composing deployment pipelines using scripting tools like Python and Bash to integrate
with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and many other CI/CD tools.

Lastly, I really enjoy studying. I use my free-time to continuously refresh my current skill-set; I really enjoy 
expanding my ongoing tech-knowledge by learning best practices and industry-standards; and this is in addition to 
pursuing training/experience opportunities which focus on soft-skill benefits. My aim is that I can continue to raise my 
technician's skill level and, my emotional intelligence level, in tandem as my career progresses.
