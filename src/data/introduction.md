
# Introduction

**Ahoy!** ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for stopping by. I'm **Lyle**, an experienced Software Engineer. My core tech skills list is an 
ongoing evolving list composed of professional experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are 
varied and located in areas such as App Development, SPAs, PWAs, Microservices, Gaming, Cloud Services, AI, 
The Internet-of-Things, Machine Learning and lots, lots more.
<br /> 

At heart, I'm a full stack engineer. I spend a lot of time expanding my skills on both front and back end tooling 
environments. Currently, I'm very much enjoying reacquainting myself as a front-end developer and the Angular
framework.

I enjoy building things and I *quite* enjoy fixing things. I like creating tech components and composing deployment 
pipelines for using scripting tools like **Python** and **Bash**. I have a long list of tech tutorials that I chew 
through in my evenings and weekends. I continuously refresh my current skill-set and I enjoy expanding my ongoing 
tech knowledge by learning new **tools**, **techniques**, and **trends**.
<br />

**Clean Code** (Martin, 2008) is at the core of my ethos: a neat-and-tidy codebase makes me *very* happy. In all 
seriousness, I appreciate sensible naming conventions for variables, classes and methods. I like **clear** 
and **inclusive** documentation. 


**In summary**: I like a well-oiled machine that's free of **palaver** or **pain**.

**Come As You Are** ðŸŽ¸
