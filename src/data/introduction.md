<b>Greetings!</b>
<br/>
My core list of tech-skills is an ongoing, evolving collection which is composed of professional
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Java Back-End Development; Spring Boot; 
Android Mobile App Development; Microservices; Cloud Tech; System Design and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Since April 2023 I've been a member with consultancy organisation CGI where my core area is Java Development with 
new responsibilities in Android mobile development too. Prior to CGI, my Java skills were strengthened while working as 
a middleware developer in the microservice data integration team with OLM Systems. Additionally, my CI/CD DevOps-skills 
were advanced while working as a Platform Engineer at Virgin Money.

<br />
I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to system-design and 
understanding the architecture of a project. When integrating the CI/CD end-to-end deployment process, I find scripting 
tools like Python a pleasure to use; automating 'chore' wherever possible when using tools like Jenkins, Docker, 
Kubernetes and many other CI/CD applications has real satisfaction for me.
<br />
<br />
I also enjoy using my free-time to expand my current skill-set. For example, I am currently deep-diving into the 
**Kotlin** language to support my entry into Android mobile development.
