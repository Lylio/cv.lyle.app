<b>Greetings!</b>
<br/>
My core list of tech-skills is an ongoing, evolving collection which is composed of professional
experience, self-taught learning and academic study. My interests are varied: Java Back-End Development; 
Android Mobile App Development; Microservices; Gaming; Cloud Tech; Ai; System Design.
<br/>
<br/>
Since April 2023 I've been a member with consultancy organisation CGI where my core area is *Java Development* with 
responsibilities in mobile development too. I currently work on the *Rural Payments and Services* 
(https://www.ruralpayments.org/) project as a middleware Java Developer. This is within the wider Agriculture and Rural 
Economies (ARE) project. Prior to CGI, my Java skills were strengthened while working as a middleware developer in the 
microservice data integration team with OLM Systems. Lastly, my CI/CD DevOps-skills were advanced while working as a 
Platform Engineer at Virgin Money.

I enjoy developing and maintaining technical estates, both greenfield and brownfield. I'm attracted to System Design and 
I enjoy understanding the architecture of a project: the *bird's eye view* is as important and interesting to me as the 
*worm's eye view*. I find scripting tools like Python and Bash a pleasure to use when integrating the CI/CD 
end-to-end deployment process; automating 'chore' where ever possible when using tools like Jenkins, Docker, 
Kubernetes and many other CI/CD applications has real job satisfaction.

I really enjoy using my free-time to refresh and expand my current skill-set. In addition to emboldening my Java skills,  
I also like deep-diving into the Kotlin language to benefit my Android mobile development.
