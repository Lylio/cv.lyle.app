          <p>The following projects have been developed using tech frameworks such as
            <b> Spring Boot</b> and <b>React</b>. Although these are fairly simple applications
            composed of typical front-end, back-end and persistence layers, I have them listed
            here to provide a little evidence of my coding skills (i.e. asking ChatGPT ðŸ¥³).
