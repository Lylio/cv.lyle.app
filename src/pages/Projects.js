          <p>The following projects demonstrate technologies such as <b>Quarkus</b>,
            <b> Spring Boot</b> and <b>React</b>. While these applications are fairly simple in
            utility, they stand as examples of how to overcome the complex challenges associated
            with deploying inter-connected systems which are composed of front end, back end and
            persistent components.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>These apps are hosted on the <i>free</i> tier of <b>Heroku</b>. Unfortunately, this
            can result in long load-times of up to 30-seconds. Your time is respected; your
            patience is appreciated â˜•.
