          <p>The following projects have been developed using technologies such as
            <b> Spring Boot</b> and <b>React</b>. These are simple applications which demonstrate
            MVC architecture patterns and are composed of typical front end, back end and
            persistence layers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>These apps are hosted on the <i>free</i> tier of the Heroku cloud platform.
            Unfortunately, this can result in long <b>load-times of up to 30-seconds</b>. Your
            patience is appreciated when trying out the demos üçÉ.
