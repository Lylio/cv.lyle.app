          <p>The following projects have been developed using hot technologies such as
            <b> Spring Boot</b> and <b>React</b>. These are fairly simple applications composed of
            typical front end, back end and persistence layers. I have them listed here to
            provide a little evidence of my coding skills (i.e. my Googling skills).
