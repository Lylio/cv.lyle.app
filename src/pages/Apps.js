          <p>The following apps have been developed using tech frameworks such as
            <b> Spring Boot</b> and <b>React</b>. Although these are fairly simple applications
            composed of typical front-end, back-end and persistence layers, I feel my CV should
            have some evidence of my coding skills (i.e. my asking ChatGPT skills ðŸ¥³).

            Click on the app <i>title</i> to have a play with the application, and the code repos
            are behind the <b><a href="https://github.com/Lylio"> GitHub logos</a></b>.
